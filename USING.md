# Using

## For end users

The app can be installed by downloading the release from the [releases](https://github.com/e-id/e-id/releases) page.

If no release is available, the app can be cloned, then installed and/or packaged.

More information can be found [here](INSTALL.md)

The app may require a middleware such as the belgian e-id middleware.

After downloading the app. It must be run at least once to registrer URL scheme and search a valid library.

Locate the e-ID icon in the system tray to open a menu where you can select a valid library (auto-selects first valid library).

The app does not need to run in the background. It can be closed at any time.

If the executable is moved, it must be run once to update its location used for the URL scheme registration.

## For developers

Developers can easily integrate Open e-ID application using its custom URL scheme `e-id://`

The protocol URL starts with callback URL. Open e-ID app will replace `e-id://` width `https://` when returning the result.

The result is url-encoded and appended to the callback URL. It can be saved inside the hash `#` or a parameter (e.g. `?e-id-result=`).

Examples:

* eid://e-id.github.io/test.html#
* eid://e-id.github.io/test.html?e-id-result=

### Options

Options are added to the URL as request parameters. They are all prefixed with `e-id-`

* `e-id-hidden` : set to `1` to hide/close the callback page after returning the result
  - the window might not be hidden depending on the platform
  - the callback page have to read the `e-id-hidden` URL parameter and call `window.close()` when equals to `'1'`

* `e-id-include` : include specific keys (coma seperated) that the app excludes by default (e.g. `photo_file`)
  - all keys containing `file` or `data` are excluded by default
  - use `*` to include all keys (including keys containing `file` or `data`)
  - some platforms might not be able to load a long URL containing all the keys[^1]
  - the app adds a `log_file` variable (not returned by default) containing the library and slot used when reading

* `e-id-exclude` : exclude specific keys (coma seperated) from the result
  - use `*` to exclude all keys
  - when excluding all keys, only `e-id-include` keys are included in the result

* `e-id-always` : set to `1` to always return a result (also on error & on cancel)

* `e-id-app` : set to `1` to start browser in app mode (dialog)
  - depends on the browser

### Result

The result contains a JSON representation of keys and values obtained from the card.

Each key is lowercased and the value is converted to string.

Keys containing `file` or `data` are encoded in base64.

The following keys are encoded as hex : `atr`, `chip_number`, `photo_hash`, `carddata_*`.

Certificates are loaded into keys prefixed with `cert_` and encoded in base64.

[^1]: due to limitations on Windows, the whole callback command will be limited to 8192 bytes
removing keys starting with `cert_`, then `data` and finally `file` keys

### Helper library

The helper library makes it easier for developers to integrate Open e-ID with their websites.

To add the helper library, just add the following code to the `head` section of the page.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://e-id.github.io/open-eid-helper.js"></script>
```

To call the app, just add a link with an URL starting with `e-id://`.

The helper library will automatically set the host and path to the current page if necessary.

Options can be set using `data-e-id-*` attributes (e.g. `data-e-id-app="1"`)

If the website is fully client-side JavaScript, you can set the URL to `e-id://#` and
the helper library will automatically get the data from the URL to the LocalStorage.

For better user experience `data-e-id-app="1"` is a recommended option.

The library will look for `data-e-id-callback` attribute and call it as a callback function
for the result taken from LocalStorage.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.eIdRead = function(result) {
    console.log(result);
  }
</script>
<a href="eid://#" data-e-id-app="1" data-e-id-callback="eIdRead">Read card</a>
```
